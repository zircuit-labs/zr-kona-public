# Run Kona Node as a Binary

:::note

If you haven't already built the `kona-node` binary, head over to the
[Installation](/node/install/overview) guide.

:::

`kona-node` is an L2 consensus client (also called a "rollup node").
This means that the node is a _consensus_-layer client, which needs
a corresponding execution-layer client in order to sync and follow
the L2 chain. A number of L2 execution layer clients are available,
since the OP Stack uses a minimal diff approach to L1 execution
clients, including [`op-reth`][op-reth] and [`op-geth`][op-geth].

This section will illustrate running the `kona-node` with an instance
of [`op-reth`][op-reth].

Out of the box, the `kona-node` can be used for any `OP Stack` chain
that is part of the [`superchain-registry`][scr]. In order to use an
out-of-band `OP Stack` chain, for example a new devnet, you'll need
to specify the rollup config using the custom `--l2-config-file`
cli flag. More on that in the
[More Detailed Node Docs Section](#-More-Detailed-Node-Docs).

<Callout type="info">
This tutorial walks through running the `kona-node` as
a binary. To use docker, head over to the
[Docker Guide](/node/run/docker) which uses a `docker-compose`
setup provided by `kona`. The `docker-compose` setup
automatically bootstraps the `kona-node` with `op-reth`,
provisioning grafana dashboards and a default Prometheus
configuration. It is encouraged to follow the
[Docker Guide](/node/run/docker) to avoid misconfigurations.
</Callout>

The `kona-node` requires a few CLI flags.

- `--l1-eth-rpc <L1_ETH_RPC>`
  URL of the L1 execution client RPC API.
- `--l1-beacon <L1_BEACON>`
  URL of the L1 beacon API.
- `--l2-engine-rpc <L2_ENGINE_RPC>`
  URL of the engine API endpoint of an L2 execution client.

The L2 engine RPC points to the execution layer client's engine API,
[`op-reth`][op-reth].

An L1 beacon endpoint and rpc endpoint are also required to
fetch the L1 chain data that the L2 chain is derived from.

First, start an instance of [`op-reth`][op-reth]. The
[`op-reth` docs][op-reth-docs] provide very detailed instructions
for running `op-reth` nodes for OP Stack chains (L2). For this
demo, we'll use `base`, but any other OP Stack chain will do.

```
op-reth node \
    --chain base \
    --rollup.sequencer-http https://mainnet-sequencer.base.org \
    --http \
    --ws \
    --authrpc.port 9551 \
    --authrpc.jwtsecret /path/to/jwt.hex
```

Kona has a `generate-jwt` justfile target that can be used to
create the `jwt.hex` file. Run `just generate-jwt`.


<Callout type="info">
The JWT token file path passed into `--authrpc.jwtsecret`
**MUST** be the same as the one passed into the `kona-node`.

This JWT token is how the `op-reth` client authenticates
requests made by the `kona-node` to the engine rpc.

By default, the `kona-node` will attempt to read a JWT token
from a `jwt.hex` file in the local directory. If it cannot
find one, it will create a JWT token in a new `jwt.hex` file.

To specify the path to the file that contains the JWT token,
pass the file path into the `--l2.jwt-secret` CLI flag or
use the `KONA_NODE_L2_ENGINE_AUTH` environment variable.
</Callout>

Then, run the `kona-node` using Base's chain id - `8453`.

```
kona-node node \
    --chain 8453 \
    --l1-eth-rpc <L1_RPC_URL> \
    --l1-beacon <L1_BEACON_URL> \
    --l2-engine-rpc http://127.0.0.1:9551 \
```

That's it! Your node should connect to P2P and start syncing
quickly.

#### RPC Trust Configuration

By default, `kona-node` trusts RPC providers and doesn't perform additional verification. 
This is suitable for local nodes but should be changed when using public RPC endpoints:

```
kona-node node \
    --chain 8453 \
    --l1-eth-rpc https://public-eth-rpc.com \
    --l1-trust-rpc false \
    --l1-beacon https://public-beacon-api.com \
    --l2-engine-rpc http://127.0.0.1:9551 \
    # L2 trust-rpc defaults to true for local engine
```

The `--l1-trust-rpc false` flag enables block hash verification for the L1 RPC, 
protecting against malicious or faulty public RPC providers.


#### Debugging

`kona-node` provides a `-v` (or `--v`) flag as a way to set
the "verbosity" level for logs. By default, the verbosity level
is set to `3`, which is the INFO level. The level ranges from `0`
being no logs to `5` which includes trace logs. Log levels are
listed below, with each level including the one below it.

- `5`: `TRACE` - very verbose logs that provide a detailed trace
- `4`: `DEBUG` - logs meant to print debugging information
- `3`: `INFO` - informational logs
- `2`: `WARN` - includes warning and error logs
- `1`: `ERROR` - only error logs are shown
- `0`: No logs

The default verbosity level is `-vvv` which is the `3` or `INFO`
level. To set the `kona-node` to print `DEBUG` logs or level `4`,
run the node like so: `kona-node node -vvvv`.

By default, the `kona-node` initializes its tracing (logging)
using the default environment variable filter [provided by the
tracing_subscriber crate][tracing-env]. This uses the value in
the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to set the tracing level
for specific targets. Effectively, `RUST_LOG` allows you to
bypass the default log level for the whole node or specific
log targets. For example, by prepending `RUST_LOG=engine=debug`
to the `kona-node` command (or setting that as an environment
variable), only `INFO` logs will be displayed except for the
`engine` log target which will also print `DEBUG` logs.

This comes in handy say for when we would like to debug Kona's
P2P stack, we could prepend `RUST_LOG=discv5=debug,libp2p=debug`
to view debug logs from only `discv5` and `libp2p` targets.


#### More Detailed Node Docs

There are a number of important defaults.

- The node will poll and update the runtime config every 10 minutes.
  Configurable via the `--l1.runtime-config-reload-interval` flag.
- The P2P stack is spun up. The libp2p swarm listens on TCP `9222`
  to receive block gossip. The `discv5` discovery service runs on
  UDP port `9223`. Peer scoring is enabled.
- An RPC server is exposed at `0.0.0.0:9545`. Websocket connections
  are disabled by default.
- Metrics are enabled, serving prometheus metrics on `0.0.0.0:9090`.
  This can be configured using the `--metrics.enabled`,
  `--metrics.port`, and `--metrics.addr` cli flags.

<Callout type="info">
If a file path to a rollup config is _not_ specified via the
`--l2-config-file` cli flag, the Rollup Config will be loaded
via the [superchain registry][scr].

A custom rollup config can either be specified through the
`--l2-config-file` flag, or specific values may be overridden
using a set of override flags provided by the `kona-node`.

Override flags (for example `--canyon-override`) can be viewed
in the help menu by running `kona-node node --help`. The only
overrides currently supported are hardfork timestamps in seconds.
</Callout>

A set of CLI flags relating to the sequencer and supervisor are
also available to the `kona-node` binary.

Now, when the `kona-node` starts up, it should immediately spin up
the P2P stack. It will begin discovering valid peers on the network
with the same chain id (base - `8453`) and OP Stack enr key "opstack".
When valid peers are discovered, they are sent to the libp2p swarm
which attempts to connect to them and listen for block gossip.

Depending on the chain, and the P2P network topology, it may take
longer for the `kona-node` to establish a strong set of peers and
begin receiving block gossip. For larger, more mature chains like
OP Mainnet and Base, peer discovery should happen quickly via the
chain's P2P bootnodes.

Once the first unsafe L2 payload attributes (block) is received
from peers in the libp2p swarm, it is sent off to the `kona-node`'s
engine actor which will kick off execution layer sync on the
`op-reth` execution client. When this happens, the `op-reth` logs
will start to show that it is fetching past L2 blocks to sync the
chain to tip.

Once EL sync is finished, `kona-node`'s derivation actor will
kick off the derivation pipeline and begin deriving the L2 chain.
All the while, the P2P stack is separately receiving unsafe L2
blocks from the chain's sequencer, and sending them off to the
engine actor to insert into the chain.
