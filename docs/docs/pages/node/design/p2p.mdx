# P2P Networking

<Callout type="info">

Partly adapted from the [OP Stack P2P Specs][p2p-specs].
Please reference the specs for up-to-date OP Stack requirements.

</Callout>

The OP Stack uses P2P networking on the consensus layer to share
the sequencer's view of the L2 chain with other nodes on the
network. L2 blocks shared via P2P are considered "unsafe", and
will be reorganized to match the canonical chain, prioritizing L1.

This means that behavior on the P2P layer does not affect the
rollup security. As such, rules around banning and scoring peers
based on their P2P gossip is policy - it is up to the user to
ultimately choose a configuration best for them.

To understand how the P2P is hooked up to the `kona-node`, jump
to the [P2P Actor](#-p2p-actor) section below. Otherwise, read
on to learn more about the details of the P2P stack.


### Topography

The P2P stack topography consists of the following.

- Discovery of peers via [discv5][discv5].
- Gossip and peer connection management through [libp2p][libp2p].
- Publishing and validation of gossip by the node.

In the `kona-node`, these layers are split up into modular
components either as modules or distinct crates.


#### Discovery

Kona's discovery layer is encapsulated in a "driver" called
the [`Discv5Driver`][driver]. When started, the driver spawns a
new thread to handle [`discv5::Discv5`][discv5-service] events
from its event stream as well as metrics requests from the
`kona-node`. A "handler" is returned by the consumed
[`Discv5Driver`][driver] which allows other components of
the `kona-node` to communicate through channels to the
spawned [`discv5::Discv5`][discv5-service] service.

When peers are discovered by kona's discovery service, their
"ENR"s need to be validated to ensure those peers are
participating in the right network gossip. Ethereum Node
Records (ENRs) and how they are validated is discussed in a
[later section](#-node-identification). After their ENRs are
validated, they are forwarded to the consumer (in kona's case
libp2p) which establishes and manages the connection to the
node.

There are also a few more notable functions of Kona's discovery
driver.

- Every X seconds it attempts to discover random ENRs. This is
  configurable using `Discv5Builder::with_interval`
- Every Y seconds it evicts a random ENR from the discovery
  table to keep peer discovery fresh. This is configurable
  using `Discv5Builder::with_discovery_randomize`.
- Every Z seconds it stores its ENR table at a configurable
  location so if the service is restarted, it doesn't need to
  rediscover peers, it can just use the stored peers. The
  interval is configurable using
  `Discv5Builder::with_store_interval`.


#### Gossip

L2 blocks on the OP Stack not otherwise derived from L1 are
shared over TCP in the P2P network of nodes. Unsafe L2 blocks
shared this way originate from the sequencer.

In the `kona-node`, L2 block gossip is handled through the
[libp2p Swarm][swarm]. The `GossipDriver` is the component
in the `kona-node` that manages the libp2p swarm, including
any interfacing with the swarm like dialing peers, publishing
payloads (L2 blocks), handling events from the swarm, and more.

<Callout type="info">

The libp2p swarm must be polled via Swarm as Stream
in order to make progress.
Through kona's `GossipDriver`, this can be done by looping
over and consuming events from `GossipDriver::next`.

</Callout>

The `GossipDriver` provides the methods to handle events
from the [libp2p Swarm][swarm]. Events should be consumed
this way in order to use the connection gater as well as peer
store and fields on the `GossipDriver`.

The [libp2p Swarm][swarm] listens on a specified
[`Multiaddr`][multiaddr].


#### L2 Block Publishing

As mentioned in [the previous section](#-gossip), L2 blocks
are published as payloads through the [libp2p Swarm][swarm],
which is done using the `GossipDriver`. The actual payload
type that is published is an [`OpNetworkPayloadEnvelope`][env],
which is well documented in the [OP Stack P2P Specs][p2p-specs].

L2 blocks published through the `GossipDriver` are published on
a "topic". The topic is used by the gossipsub protocol to publish
the message on that given topic, allowing peers to choose which
topics they wish to subscribe to.


#### L2 Block Validation

L2 blocks are validated in kona through a trait-abstracted
"block handler". Since messages in the libp2p mesh network are
snappy compressed, they need to be decompressed and then decoded
for the correct [block topic][block-topic] those messages are
published on.

Only once the [`OpNetworkPayloadEnvelope`][env] is successfully
decoded for the corresponding block topic, is the block validated.

<Callout type="info">

Block validity in kona follows the [OP Stack block validation specs][validation].

</Callout>

As of writing these docs, block validation follows a few rules.

- The timestamp is between 60 seconds in the past and at most 5 seconds in the future.
- The block hash is valid. This is checked by transforming the payload into a block
  and then hashing the block header to produce the payload hash.
- The contents of the payload envelope are correct for its version. Since different
  versions introduce new contents to the payload from hardforks, the
  forwards-compatible payload envelope cannot have fields with content that don't exist
  for previous versions.
- The block signature is valid.
