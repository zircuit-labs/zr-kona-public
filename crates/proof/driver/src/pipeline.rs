//! Abstracts the derivation pipeline from the driver.
//!
//! This module provides the [`DriverPipeline`] trait which serves as a high-level
//! abstraction for the driver's derivation pipeline. The pipeline is responsible
//! for deriving L2 blocks from L1 data and producing payload attributes for execution.

/// High-level abstraction for the driver's derivation pipeline.
///
/// The [`DriverPipeline`] trait extends the base [`Pipeline`] functionality with
/// driver-specific operations needed for block production. It handles the complex
/// logic of stepping through derivation stages, managing resets and reorgs, and
/// producing payload attributes for block building.
///
/// ## Key Responsibilities
/// - Stepping through derivation pipeline stages
/// - Handling L1 origin advancement
/// - Managing pipeline resets due to reorgs or activation signals
/// - Producing payload attributes for disputed blocks
/// - Caching and cache invalidation
///
/// ## Error Handling
/// The pipeline can encounter several types of errors:
/// - **Temporary**: Retryable errors (e.g., missing data)
/// - **Reset**: Errors requiring pipeline reset (e.g., reorgs, activations)
/// - **Critical**: Fatal errors that stop derivation

    /// when a reorganization is detected on the L1 chain. It ensures

    /// [`OpAttributesWithParent`] that can be used for block building. It handles
    /// the complex stepping logic including error recovery, resets, and reorgs.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `l2_safe_head` - The current L2 safe head block info to build upon
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// * `Ok(OpAttributesWithParent)` - Successfully produced payload attributes
    /// * `Err(PipelineErrorKind)` - Pipeline error preventing payload production
    ///
    /// # Errors
    /// This method can fail with various error types:
    /// - **Temporary errors**: Insufficient data, retries automatically
    /// - **Reset errors**: Reorg detected or activation needed, triggers pipeline reset
    /// - **Critical errors**: Fatal issues that require external intervention
    ///
    /// # Behavior
    /// The method operates in a loop, continuously stepping the pipeline until:
    /// 1. Payload attributes are successfully produced
    /// 2. A critical error occurs
    /// 3. The pipeline signals completion
    ///
    /// ## Reset Handling
    /// When reset errors occur:
    /// - **Reorg detected**: Flushes cache and resets to safe head
    /// - **Holocene activation**: Sends activation signal
    /// - **Other resets**: Standard reset to safe head with system config
    ///
    /// ## Step Results
    /// The pipeline can return different step results:
    /// - **PreparedAttributes**: Attributes ready for the next block
    /// - **AdvancedOrigin**: L1 origin moved forward
    /// - **OriginAdvanceErr/StepFailed**: Various error conditions
