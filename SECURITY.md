# Zircuit Bug Bounty Program: Zircuit core

**Last updated on Nov 13th 2025**

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

- Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly or test them on production networks.
  Violating this policy will forfeit your right to a reward and may put users at
  risk.
- Do not file public issues disclosing the vulnerability.
- Do not test vulnerabilities on public testnets or mainnets.
- Submit all findings via the approved disclosure channel below.

## Reporting Process

- All vulnerabilities must be reported via email to: bugbounty@zircuit.com
- Reports must include:
    - Impacted repository and commit SHA where the vulnerable code exists
    - A detailed description of the issue, including a justification of the
      severity level (impact, feasibility and likelihood).
    - Steps to reproduce
    - A working and reproducible Proof of Concept (PoC)
    - How to fix the issue
- We strongly recommend encrypting your report using our PGP public key
  (instructions below) to protect sensitive details
- Our team will acknowledge the reception of your submission, assess its
  validity, may ask for further clarification if needed and will close the topic
  with a final decision regarding the validity of the submission.
- Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before any public
  disclosure.

## Scope of the Program

### In-Scope Components

- Zircuit code
    - zkr-go-common-official (main branch)
    - zkr-monorepo-official (main branch)
    - l2-geth-official (main branch)
    - zr-kona-official (main branch)
    - op-succinct-official (main branch)
- Zircuit Smart Contracts
    - zkr-monorepo-official/packages/contracts-bedrock/src (main branch)
    - On-chain addresses:
        - https://docs.zircuit.com/addresses/l1-bridge
        - https://docs.zircuit.com/addresses/l2-predeploys

### Out-of-Scope

- Code that is not used in Production
- Known and previously disclosed vulnerabilities to Zircuit
- Known issues in the OP Stack, Geth, Kona, or OP-Succinct
- Best practices or non-impactful code preferences
- Experimental or undeployed features
- Front-end, infrastructure bugs and Zircuit staking (a separate policy exists:
  https://docs.zircuit.com/info/security/bug-bounty)
- Social engineering or physical attacks against our employees or customers
- Purely theoretical issues without a Proof of Concept
- The program covers only the code that Zircuit has modified, or added in the
  repositories listed above. The parts of the code that were not modified from
  the original upstream projects (for example: OP Stack, Geth, Kona, OP-Succinct
  and other “vanilla” upstream sources) are **out of scope** (we recommend
  reporting in a responsible manner to the responsible team) **unless** the
  reporter either:
    - demonstrates a vulnerability introduced by Zircuit’s modifications (i.e.,
      the issue is present in Zircuit’s forked repository because of changes made
      by Zircuit), or
    - provides a working Proof-of-Concept that shows an exploit path that is only
      exploitable in Zircuit’s production environment (for example due to
      Zircuit’s configuration, bundled dependencies, packaging, integration, or
      feature flags).

### Unscoped findings

We welcome any relevant vulnerabilities **outside of the official scope**.
Rewards will be granted **at our discretion** for significant and relevant
findings. Note that a Proof of Concept is required in that case as well.

## Severity Classification System

- **Critical**:
    - Large amounts of funds permanently lost
    - Ability to cause the protocol to finalize an invalid state transition or to
      accept a corrupted canonical state
    - Denial of service (more than 24 hours) with broad impact (e.g., withdrawals
      delayed, core operations impaired) without requiring extraordinary attacker
      cost
- **High**:
    - Medium amounts of funds permanently lost (e.g. only affecting individual
      users or edge cases)
    - Large amounts of funds temporarily frozen (more than 6 hours) without
      requiring extraordinary attacker cost.
    - Temporary denial of service (more than 6 hours) with broad impact (e.g.,
      withdrawals delayed, core operations impaired) without requiring
      extraordinary attacker cost.
- **Medium**:
    - Limited amounts of funds permanently lost (e.g., rounding errors, improper
      fee calculation, unlikely edge cases)
    - Medium amounts of funds temporarily frozen (more than 6 hours and only
      affecting individual users or edge cases) without requiring extraordinary
      attacker cost.

### Disclaimers

For the triage, we will consider the following aspects to assess the correctness
of the claimed severity:

- **Privileges & Preconditions**: If exploit requires privileged role (owner,
  admin), or only works under very rare chain states, that may reduce severity.
- **Scope / Breadth**: Whether only one user / one contract is affected vs many
  users / core contracts / the protocol’s treasury.
- **Recovery / Mitigations**: If the protocol has pre-stated mechanisms
  (pausing, emergency withdrawal, ability to upgrade) that can limit damage, or
  if vulnerabilities are mitigated at an operational level, that may reduce
  severity.

## Rewards

The reward amount is determined by the **severity of the bug** and **funds at
risk**. We follow an internal model to assess risk and impact.

- **Critical**: Up to $50,000
- **High**: Up to $15,000
- **Medium**: Up to $5,000

Reward amounts may vary based on factors such as:

- The exploitability of the vulnerability
- The impact on funds and system integrity
- The quality of the report and proof of concept

**For payouts, we**:

- We offer payments in USDC, USDT and USD.
- We require invoices.
- We require KYC.

## Eligibility & Legal

Participation in this program is open to security researchers, but must comply
with applicable laws.

For a given issue, the first eligible and valid report submitted for the root
cause of that issue will get the reward.

Any prior direct or indirect access to confidential information may lead to
ineligibility to participate. If unsure, ask us by email to:
bugbounty@zircuit.com.

**Participation in our Bug Bounty Program is subject to our terms and
conditions. By submitting a report, you agree to these terms, which include
confidentiality provisions and a release of claims against Zircuit.**

## Program Governance

Zircuit reserves the right to:

- Bypass this policy and disclose sooner if necessary for user protection
- Privately notify selected downstream users before a public disclosure
- Adjust this policy and its terms as the program evolves

## Resources

### Testing guidelines

Please do not test on production. We recommend setting up a local environment
for safe testing. Local forks of Mainnet as PoCs are accepted, if they
demonstrate the feasibility of the attack. For testing guidelines, please look
at the README files.
